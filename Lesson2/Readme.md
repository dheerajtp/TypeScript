## Lesson 2


1. We can declare a value as type of any as follows 

```
let album:any;
```

it gives album any type of value


2. Union Type in TypeScript

a vairble which can be of a string or a number or a boolean etc can be declared as follows

```
let album:string | number;
```


3. Regular expression

It is mainly used when we are going to change a project from js to ts when we are unsure about the datatype or value of variable
```
let regularExpression:RegExp = /\w+/g
```
